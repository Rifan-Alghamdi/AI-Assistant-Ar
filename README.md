##üìå Overview

Smart Assistant is an interactive Arabic voice assistant that allows users to ask questions and receive intelligent responses ‚Äî both in text and speech.  
Built using Cohere's command-r-plus model for natural language generation and gTTS for voice output, the assistant provides a smooth and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

This project was created as part of the Summer Training ‚Äì AI Track in the Full Stack Robotics Engineer program.

‚ùì FAQ

Q: Why is the voice delayed sometimes?
A: For longer answers, the voice may take an extra second to be generated and played. This is normal due to TTS processing.

Q: Can I change the language?
A: The assistant is currently optimized for Arabic input/output only.
